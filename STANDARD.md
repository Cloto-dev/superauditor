# SuperAuditor Standard (v1.1)

A delivery contract for **findings**: the drift, staleness and integrity
observations a server already computes about its own stored state. The standard
specifies how a server *reports* findings — the seam — and deliberately says
nothing about what a server chooses to detect.

The name encodes the job description. An auditor inspects and reports. It does
not repair, and it does not decide what the operator should do next.

## Status of this document

**v1.1, extracted from two running implementations.** v1 was extracted from
CScheduler 0.9.0 (2026-07-31), where the pull contract, severity vocabulary and
cap semantics were shipped and measured in production before the text was
written. v1.1 adds what the second implementation, CPersona (2.5.10 and later),
had to decide that v1 did not say: how a deterministic escalation fits a static
severity map (§4), what a probe that could not run looks like (§5.4), and what
happens when a detector's own output uses a reserved key (§3). It also has a
response state the version it conforms to (§5.2).

Both implementations are Python MCP servers by the same maintainer. Treat
requirements that look unusual as evidence from two related systems, not as
settled practice across languages and teams.

**No shared library.** Implementations MUST NOT be required to link a common
runtime. Consistency is carried by this document, the response schema in
`schema/` and the conformance fixtures in `conformance/v1/`, so an
implementation in another language is never forced to port another language's
bugs. This repository also ships a reference delivery transform to copy
(`examples/`) and a black-box checker that talks to a running server
(`superauditor-check`); neither is a runtime dependency.

Key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY are used per
RFC 2119.

## 1. Motivation

A server that computes findings has to decide when to hand them over. The cheap
default is to attach them to every read, and that is what CScheduler did for 13
read tools.

Measured on real transcripts before the change (2026-07-31, 97 calls to the
carrier tools):

- the findings block was a median of **4,578 characters, or about 2,773
  tokens**, per response — **43.9%** of the payload it rode on, and up to
  **99.1%** of a small one;
- the only consumer read it **once**, at the end of a session;
- because the block is pushed, unresolved state converts directly into a
  per-call fixed cost: findings nobody acts on are re-billed on every read.

Push delivery also makes findings *ambient*. They arrive unrequested, in the
middle of unrelated work, which is precisely when they are least actionable.

The fix is not to detect less. It is to separate **detection**, which is
unchanged, from **delivery**, which becomes pull, on demand.

## 2. Scope and non-goals

In scope — the seam:

- the shape of a finding;
- the `severity` vocabulary and how severity is assigned;
- the pull tool, its parameters and its response;
- honest reporting of truncation and of probes that did not run;
- how findings relate to a caller's isolation filters and session identity;
- how an existing broadcast is retired without breaking its consumers.

Out of scope. These are named here because scope creep is the specific failure
this document exists to prevent.

- **No execution layer.** Acting on a finding takes judgment. The standard
  delivers, and the operator decides. A detector that also acts is a policy
  engine wearing a data layer's clothes.
- **No auto-fix.** Repair tools (a `check_health(fix=true)`, for example) keep
  their repairs. A SuperAuditor implementation MUST NOT mutate state.
- **No detection catalogue.** What counts as a finding is each server's
  business. CScheduler detects semantic drift in a plan graph; CPersona reports
  storage integrity. Same contract, different contents.
- **No confidence scores.** See §4.
- **No probe-accuracy requirements.** Improving a detector is orthogonal work,
  and MUST NOT be smuggled in through this contract.

## 3. The finding object

A finding is a JSON object. Two keys are defined by this standard:

| key | type | requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | string | MUST. A stable, server-defined identifier for the class of finding (e.g. `stale_pending`). |
| `severity` | string | MUST. One of the values in §4. |

All other keys are the payload, and are server-defined: the identifiers, counts,
ages or titles a consumer needs in order to act. Consumers MUST tolerate unknown
payload keys.

The `kind` vocabulary is **not** standardized. Two implementations sharing a
kind name SHOULD mean the same thing by it, but the standard does not enumerate
kinds and does not reserve names. A probe MAY emit more than one kind (§4).

**Reserved keys in a detector's own output.** A detector written before its
server adopted this standard may already emit a key named `kind` or `severity`
with a meaning of its own — an object type, or its own graded verdict.

- An implementation MUST NOT deliver such a value under the reserved name. In a
  delivered finding, `kind` and `severity` mean only what this section and §4
  say.
- It SHOULD keep the value by moving it to a payload key of its own choosing,
  and SHOULD document the move. Dropping it loses information a consumer may
  need to act.
- A move MUST NOT overwrite a key the detector already emitted. If the
  destination name is taken, the implementation MUST refuse (fail the call, or
  report the probe as not run, §5.4) rather than deliver a finding whose payload
  silently means something else.

CPersona moves a probe's own `kind` to `object_kind` and its own graded
`severity` to `health_severity`, and refuses when either name is already
present.

## 4. Severity

Exactly three values, ordered:

| severity | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `critical` | The read contract is broken right now — data a caller has already been given cannot be trusted. |
| `warn` | Two stored facts contradict each other; something is wrong now. |
| `info` | An observation or suggestion; whether to act is a judgment call. |

The assignment rules are these.

1. **Severity MUST be a property of the `kind`, not of the instance.**
   Implementations MUST assign severity from a static per-kind map. No model
   judgment, no per-finding scoring, no confidence values. A consumer must be
   able to route on severity without re-deriving it.
2. **The map MUST be exhaustive over the probe registry**, enforced by a test
   that fails when a probe kind has no entry. An implementation MAY also carry
   a runtime fallback, and if it does, the fallback MUST be the weakest
   severity (`info`). An unmapped probe must not be able to manufacture an
   alarm.
3. **A probe whose premise is a lexical match MUST NOT be `warn` or
   `critical`.** Keyword matching over free text produces plausible findings
   that are wrong. In the CScheduler pilot, such a probe measured 0/5 precision
   against full reads of the flagged records. A finding whose evidence is a
   string match does not get to claim a defect.

**Deterministic escalation (v1.1).** Rule 1 excludes judgment, not structure.
Some detectors grade an instance by a fixed rule — a threshold on a ratio, or
whether a component is configured. Such a detector conforms by giving **each
tier its own kind**, each with its own static severity, so the tier becomes part
of what the finding *is*:

| kind | severity | when the detector emits it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `null_embedding_expected` | `info` | missing vectors are the configured steady state |
| `null_embedding` | `warn` | a vector client is configured and some rows have none |
| `null_embedding_pipeline_down` | `critical` | more than half the rows have none |

- An implementation MUST NOT conform by copying an instance's tier into
  `severity` under a single kind. That is per-instance severity, and a consumer
  routing on `(kind, severity)` would see one kind carry three meanings.
- The tier rule MUST be a pure function of the detector's own output; it names
  the branch the detector already took and scores nothing.
- A verdict the detector gives the same instance for another purpose (a health
  gate's own severity, for example) MAY travel in the payload under a
  non-reserved name (§3).

Implementations MAY leave a severity unused. CScheduler emits no `critical`,
because drift in a plan graph never falsifies a read.

## 5. Pull delivery

### 5.1 The tool

```
get_session_findings(session_key?, per_kind_limit?, include_summary?) -> object
```

The tool MUST be read-only, and MUST be safe to call at any time. It is the
consumer's decision when findings are worth paying for, and the server MUST NOT
second-guess it by rate-limiting or caching stale results.

| parameter | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session_key` | absent | Opaque, client-declared session identity (§7). |
| `per_kind_limit` | `5` | Maximum findings returned **per kind**. |
| `include_summary` | `true` | Include the human-readable `summary` rendering. |

`include_summary=false` exists because the prose restates `findings`. A machine
consumer MUST be able to decline paying for it.

### 5.2 The response

```json
{
  "findings":            [ { "kind": "stale_pending", "severity": "info", "task_id": 6, "days_stale": 62 } ],
  "total":               34,
  "counts_by_kind":      { "stale_pending": 20, "active_goal_claims_achievement": 13, "duplicate_pending": 1 },
  "counts_by_severity":  { "info": 33, "warn": 1 },
  "capped_kinds":        ["stale_pending"],
  "per_kind_limit":      20,
  "summary":             "Drift / maintenance findings: …",
  "identity_shared":     true,
  "_meta":               { "server_version": "0.9.0", "superauditor": "1.1" }
}
```

| key | requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `findings` | MUST. The trimmed set, after `per_kind_limit` is applied. |
| `total` | MUST. The number of findings **returned**. It is NOT the true number that exist — truncation is reported by `capped_kinds`, not by this field. |
| `counts_by_kind` / `counts_by_severity` | MUST. Computed over the returned set, so they always agree with `findings`. |
| `capped_kinds` | MUST. See §6. Present and empty when nothing was capped. |
| `per_kind_limit` | MUST. Echoes the limit actually applied, so a consumer reading a stored response can interpret `capped_kinds` without knowing the request. |
| `summary` | MUST be present when `include_summary` is true, and MUST be rendered from the same trimmed set as `findings` — prose and structure never disagree. |
| `identity_shared` | MUST be present and `true` when §7 applies; SHOULD be omitted otherwise. |
| `_meta.server_version` | MUST. The running instance identifies itself. |
| `_meta.superauditor` | MUST for an implementation that claims v1.1 or later: the version of this standard the response conforms to, as `"<major>.<minor>"`. Absent means v1. (v1.1) |

A server's version does not say which contract it speaks: a behaviour change
can ship without a version bump, and two servers share no version scheme.
`_meta.superauditor` is how a consumer or a checker knows which rules to read
the response by.

The response MUST NOT carry the broadcast block (§8). This tool *is* the
findings channel, and attaching the push payload would bill it twice.

The response's shape is also given as a JSON Schema in
`schema/get_session_findings.response.schema.json`. Where the schema and this
text disagree, the text wins.

### 5.3 One detector

When an implementation delivers findings through more than one channel — during
a broadcast migration, for example — all channels MUST be fed by a single
detection implementation. A probe MUST NOT be able to mean one thing when pushed
and another when pulled.

### 5.4 A probe that did not run (v1.1)

A probe can raise, time out, or be unable to run. The response MUST NOT make
that indistinguishable from a probe that found nothing. Two shapes conform:

- **The call fails as a whole** (a tool error). Simple, and it tells the
  consumer the audit did not happen. CScheduler does this.
- **The response is a partial result that says so.** In place of the failed
  probe's findings, the response carries a finding for the failure. Its kind
  SHOULD be `check_crashed`, its severity SHOULD be `warn` (the audit is
  incomplete now), and its payload SHOULD name the probe that failed. CPersona
  does this.

Silently omitting a probe's findings because the probe failed is not
conforming.

## 6. Honest caps

`per_kind_limit` truncates, and a naive implementation truncates and says
nothing: a kind sitting at exactly the limit is indistinguishable from a kind
with two hundred rows. That is a lie a consumer cannot detect.

- Implementations MUST report, in `capped_kinds`, every kind that had more
  findings available than were returned.
- Implementations MUST determine this by observation, not by inference. The
  reference technique is to probe at `per_kind_limit + 1` and trim the extra row
  back before returning. Concluding "capped" from `count == limit` is NOT
  conforming, because it reports a kind that happens to have exactly `limit`
  findings as truncated.
- Truncation that goes unreported anywhere in the response is forbidden.
- Trimming MUST preserve the detector's ordering: the findings kept for a kind
  are its first `per_kind_limit`. Reordering (by severity, age, or anything
  else) MAY happen before trimming, but the pair (detector output,
  `per_kind_limit`) MUST determine the returned set. The fixtures in §9 depend
  on it, and so does a consumer that raises the limit for one kind and expects
  the rows it already saw to come first.

The pilot measured why this matters. The broadcast, capped at 5 per kind, showed
11 findings where the pull with a higher limit returned 34.

The standard does not give the true number of findings in a capped kind. A
consumer that needs it pulls again with a higher `per_kind_limit`, for the kinds
it intends to act on.

## 7. Session identity and isolation

**Session identity.** `session_key` is an opaque, client-declared label: a
partition hint, not authentication. Implementations that carry session-scoped
probes ("records this session touched and left pending", for example) MUST scope
them by the declared key.

Where a deployment cannot distinguish sessions — a shared remote transport with
no key declared — the implementation MUST say so with `identity_shared: true`
rather than guessing. Degrading honestly is required; degrading without saying
so is not conforming.

**Isolation filters.** Findings MUST NOT be filtered by the caller's isolation
axes (project, agent, tenant, or equivalent). The purpose of the channel is to
surface forgotten state, and slicing it by the bucket the caller happens to be
reading would hide exactly the records that were forgotten. Implementations MUST
document this, because it is the opposite of what every other read in such a
server does.

## 8. Coexisting with an existing broadcast

An implementation that already pushes findings onto unrelated responses MUST NOT
be required to break its consumers to conform. The migration contract:

1. Ship the pull tool first. It is purely additive.
2. Gate the broadcast behind a runtime knob with at least the values `all`
   (existing behaviour) and `off` (no push). An intermediate value that keeps
   the push on a single designated response — CScheduler uses `context`, its
   session-start read — is RECOMMENDED, because it lets the remaining consumer
   keep working while every other response is freed.
3. **The default at introduction MUST preserve existing behaviour
   byte-for-byte**, proven by test. Operators opt in.
4. An unrecognized knob value MUST fall back to the existing behaviour and log a
   warning. A typo in a deployment environment MUST NOT blind an audit without
   saying so.
5. The broadcast payload SHOULD be left frozen — in particular, an
   implementation SHOULD NOT add `severity` to it. Changing the bytes of
   existing responses for a consumer that does not read the new key forfeits the
   byte-identical default for nothing. The asymmetry between the two channels
   resolves when the broadcast is switched off, not by editing it now.

## 9. Conformance

An implementation conforms when it satisfies every MUST above and demonstrates
the following with tests. The last column says where each can be shown.

| id | requirement | shown by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Trimming: no kind exceeds `per_kind_limit` in `findings`. | fixtures, checker |
| C2 | `capped_kinds` names every kind that had more available, and only those — including the boundary case of exactly `per_kind_limit`. | fixtures, checker |
| C3 | `total`, `counts_by_kind` and `counts_by_severity` are computed over the returned set and agree with `findings`. | fixtures, checker |
| C4 | Severity comes from the static map; the same `kind` always yields the same `severity`. | fixtures, checker |
| C5 | An unmapped `kind` resolves to `info` (if a fallback exists at all). | fixtures |
| C6 | The severity map is exhaustive over the probe registry — a new probe with no entry fails a test rather than defaulting silently. | own tests |
| C7 | Findings are not filtered by the caller's isolation axes. | own tests |
| C8 | Under a shared transport with no declared `session_key`, the response carries `identity_shared: true`. | own tests |
| C9 | With a broadcast present: the default knob value reproduces pre-change responses byte-for-byte, and each other value drops the push from exactly the responses it claims. | own tests |
| C10 | A probe that raises is not indistinguishable from a probe that found nothing (§5.4). (v1.1) | own tests |
| C11 | A detector's own `kind` or `severity` is never delivered under the reserved name, and a move never overwrites another payload key (§3). (v1.1) | own tests |
| C12 | The response carries `_meta.superauditor` with the version claimed (§5.2). (v1.1) | checker |

The fixtures are pure functions of (input findings, `per_kind_limit`) and so are
language-independent: an implementation feeds each case's detector output
through its own delivery path and compares. The checker talks to a running
server and can show only what is visible from outside; it reads C2 by pulling
twice at different limits (a kind with more findings at the higher limit than
the lower one returned must have been capped at the lower one), and it also
checks that the rows kept at the lower limit are the first rows of the higher
pull (§6, ordering).

An implementation that has no broadcast is exempt from C9.

## 10. Versioning

This document is versioned independently of any implementation. Additive
clarifications increment the minor version. A change that invalidates a
conforming implementation increments the major version, and MUST be accompanied
by a migration note. The fixture directory is versioned with the major version
(`conformance/v1/`).

An implementation states the version it conforms to in `_meta.superauditor`
(§5.2). An implementation that conforms to v1 conforms to v1.1 once it adds that
key and meets C10 and C11.

Canonical home: this repository. v1 was first published in the CPersona
repository, which now points here.

## Appendix: changes from v1

- §3: rules for a detector's own `kind` / `severity` (move, never overwrite).
- §4: deterministic escalation conforms by distinct kinds, not per-instance
  severity.
- §5.2: `_meta.superauditor` states the version claimed.
- §5.4: a probe that did not run is reported, as a failed call or a
  `check_crashed` finding.
- §6: the true count of a capped kind is out of scope; pull again for it.
- §9: C10–C12, and where each requirement can be shown.
